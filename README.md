# Cezars Chipher
Cyphering and deciphering Cezar's cipher - C++ Console App

Program that encrypts and decrypts the Caesar Cipher.

Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

Caesar code is achieved byÂ shifting the alphabetical order by the key value. 
Entry is made in main, after the user chooses whether to encrypt or decrypt. The key is also entered. 
After that, the message is passed to a function that encrypts or decrypts it based on the key.
